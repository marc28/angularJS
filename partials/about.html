<p>I'll throw in a paragraph tag also!! Philippe Coutinho's fan club is growing. Liverpool legend Peter Beardsley is a fully paid up member.
Beardsley knows a thing or two about tormenting defenders.
He was a wizard with the ball at his feet, scoring 59 goals in 175 appearances for the Reds between 1987 and 1991.
Now the 52-year-old is relishing watching the new kid on the block. Beardsley is excited about what the future holds for the pint-sized Brazilian, who he believes is destined to join Anfield's pantheon of greats.</p>
